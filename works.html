It gives a new life to one’s clothing, to one’s planet, as well as to a love relationship that is too quickly abandoned. Second chance is a love story between us, our clothes and our planet.</p>

						<p id="projdesc">What is love? Many will just say "Baby, don't hurt me". But when we think of it, Love is  maybe the most complicated and blurry feeling. It is in the center of stories, songs, passions. Some will say that it's just a chemical process that goes into our brain, but the thing is : there is no real answer.<br><br>So, to push forward the research on this topic, I created LoveID, a love-analysing software made to understand yourself a bit more.</p>
