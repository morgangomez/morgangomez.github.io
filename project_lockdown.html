					<p id="projtext">This project shows how I felt during the first lockdown in France, which lasted 3 months from March to June 2020.<br><br>I really felt overwhelmed by all the media and screens that were surrounding me. I was living to see the next "breaking news" or the latest "COVID-19 numbers". What did the coronavirus do today? Is there any more death? What is the government doing? Who? What? Why? Where? <strong id="liendesc">I was addicted to 24/7 media channels</strong>. Since the beginning of the lockdown, I felt like a lab rat, studied, observed, watched by all these screens that were ready to yell their latest #BreakingNews at me.<br>My state of mind was very unstable and changed every other day. That's why I made a series of photos where each picture shows a particular state of mind that I was in at the time: <strong id="liendesc">indifference, boredom, curiosity, obsession, oppression, surrendering, apathy, hope, freedom</strong>. I wanted to make sure that the boundaries between what was in my head and what was reality were as blurry as possible. <br><br>This is the story of how the media and screens locked me down, and how I broke free from my own obsession.</p>
